## Dry Suit Diver Course Dives

### Confined Water Dive
1. Knowledge Review/Briefing
2. Predive Procedures – Above Water Skill Practice
3. Dive Tasks
   * Put on and remove a dry suit with the aid of another diver if necessary for that model dry suit.
   * Demonstrate how to conduct a buoyancy check at the surface while wearing a dry suit with undergarments (when needed) and full scuba equipment.
   * Demonstrate neutral buoyancy by gently rising and falling in a controlled manner during inhalation and exhalation for one minute.
   * Demonstrate neutral buoyancy by hovering (without kicking or sculling) near the bottom for one minute.
   * Disconnect and reconnect the low-pressure hose from the dry suit inflator valve while underwater.
   * Perform a neutrally buoyant ascent from the bottom, at a rate no faster than 9 metres/30 feet per minute.
   * Demonstrate one technique for recovering from excess gas in the feet.
   * Remove and replace both the scuba unit and weight system while on the surface.

### Dive 1
1. Knowledge Review/Briefing
2. Predive Procedures – Above Water Skill Practice
3. Dive 1 Tasks
   * Put on and remove a dry suit with the aid of another diver.

   * Perform a controlled descent, avoiding suit squeeze.
   * Demonstrate neutral buoyancy by gently rising and falling in a controlled manner during inhalation and exhalation for one minute.
   * Maintain neutral buoyancy near the bottom by hovering (without kicking or sculling) for one minute.
   * Maintain neutral buoyancy during the dive and avoid accidentally kicking up silt or touching the bottom.
   * Perform a neutrally buoyant ascent from the bottom, at a rate no faster than 9 metres/30 feet per minute.
