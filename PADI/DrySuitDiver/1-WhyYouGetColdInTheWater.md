# Dry Suit Diver

## Why You Get Cold Underwater
* Water transfers heat 20x faster than air due to having a higher heat capacity
  * Hence why we can last hours in cold air temp, but only a few minutes sometimes in cold water
* Alcohol makes you feel warmer but makes you colder
  * it dilates skin capillaries which increases blood flow to the skin, making you feel warm but brings warmth to the surface which is then taken away from water
* don't urinate to keep warm
  * the urine is warm due to your own internal heat. it will make you feel warm but not for long
    * it will also make your body think it is warmer than it is and shut down the heat saving measures

Eight variables to if you feel the cold:
* Water temp
* Length of exposure
* Thermal protection (suit)
  * doesnt keep you warm, it just slows down the heat loss
* body's ability to generate heat
  * lean muscle generates heat
  * more muscle normally means more heat
    * relates to metabolism, as if you are hungry you will still chill
* body fat composition
* surface area-to-mass ratio
  * short heavier divers tend to stay warmer than tall light divers
* acclimatization
  * if you tend to dive in colder areas, if you were to then dive in a slightly warmer area, it would feel a lot warmer. Its what you're used to
* activity level
  * move more to generate heat

## Hypothermia
* internal body temp is around 37c, +- 4c
* symptoms:
  * uncontrollable shivering
  * widespread numbness in the extremities
  * blueness in the lips
  * sleepiness
  * general fatigue
  * confusion
  * unconsciousness
* If you experience shivering, **treat it as a warning sign and end the dive**
