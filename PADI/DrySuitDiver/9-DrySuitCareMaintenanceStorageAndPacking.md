## Dry Suit Care, Maintenance, Storage, And Packing
### Maintenance and Storage
#### Suit
* Proper maintenance is a very good way to avoid dry suit problems
* Should rinse off the dry suit with fresh clean water after a dive
  * Close the zipper
  * Try and keep the inside of the suit dry
  * flush the valves regularly
* Dont have to clean the inside, only if there is a lot of sweat / leaked water
* Once done, hang the suit and be sure to not crease or stain it
  * hang it over a thick piece of wood or plastic tubing
* keep it out of sunlight
* Zipper
  * due to the zipper being the most important and delicate part
    * its a good idea to clean it with a soft tooth brush and soapy water
    * if its very dirty after a dive, keep the suit on and clean what you can, then take it off
    * Lube the zupper with **paraffin zipper wax**
      * dont use silicone
* Seals
  * once dry, dust the seals in pure talcum powder.
  * Dont use silicone spray or preservative sprays
* Loosely roll or fold the suit
  * With latex seals, tuck them into the suit
  * Depending on the suit, keep the zipper open / closed
* Pack the suit into a sealed plastic bag, to reduce ozone exposure
  * store in a cool dry place
  * Dont store it hanging

#### Undergarments
* Launder according to manufacturers label
  * Some undergarments say to not use soap, etc

### Packing
* dont just jam the suit into the bag, it can damage the shell and the zipper
* use the storage bag it comes with
* pack it by itself, not with other equipment (its own bag)
* Pack it in a way that if something heavy were to be ontop of it, it wouldnt damage the zipper
* can roll or pack the undergarments in a separate bag, or in a different compartment of the dry suit bag
  * can use it as padding for the suit if it is in the same bag

### Annual Servicing
* You should annually service the dry suit
* replace the seals / valves if needed
