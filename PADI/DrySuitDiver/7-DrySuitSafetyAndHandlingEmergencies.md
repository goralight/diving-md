# Dry Suit Diver
## Dry Suit Safety And Handling Emergencies
### Suit Squeeze
* because you are surrounded by gas and not water, you can experience a suit squeeze
* happens when you descend without adding gas to the suit
  * the gas compress under the rising pressure, causing a squeeze against you
  * can lead to welts and bruises
  * and even restrict breathing by compressing the chest and neck
* Cause:
  * Descending with a disconnected inflator, malfunctioning inflator, or simply forgetting to add gas during descent can cause a suit squeeze
  * Prevention:
    * Check that the inflator is connected and operates properly during your pre dive safety check. Add gas regularly during descent
  * Correction:
    * If you discover you cannot inflate your suit, immediately stop your descent. Use your BCD if necessary to restore neutral buoyancy
    * If you cannot correct the problem and inflate your suit, abort the dive.

### Excess Buoyancy
* Dangerous as can lead to rapid runaway ascent
* Cause 1:
  * Inflator valve stuck open
    * Can be due to corrosion or valve freezing open
  * Prevention:
    * Proper maintenance
    * check valve before dive
    * short bursts when opening valve
  * Correction:
    * disconnect inflator hose
    * dump excess gas immediately through exhaust valve
    * can also open wrist seal and exhaust gas out (you will get wet)
    * if near secured line can use it to control ascent
    * If you cant vent gas quick enough and you are ascending out of control:
      * flare out your body, facing the surface
      * create the most drag
      * continue to vent gas through wrist and exhaust valve
      * dont hold breath (make a AHHHH sound as you exhale)
* Cause 2:
  * Exhaust valve is stuck closed
    * Same reasons as inflator valve
  * Prevention:
    * maintenance and servicing
    * check before dive
  * Correction:
    * Vent gas through wrist or neck seal
    * use ascent line to slow ascent 
    * flare body and dump gas through seals
* Cause 3:
  * Lost weights and unable to recover
    * can happen if you trip the quick release whilst underwater
    * most common is not securing it properly in the first place
  * Prevention:
    * Be familiar with weight system
    * check its set up correctly and functioning before dive
    * use more than one system
  * Correction:
    * Vent gas through valves
    * use ascent line to slow ascent 
    * flare body
    * dont hold breath (make a AHHHH sound as you exhale)
* Cause 4:
  * Overweighted
    * Need excessive gas to offset the weight
      * meaning more than normal gas volume expanding during ascent. If the expansion exceeds the exhaust valve’s capacity to vent gas, the diver may become overly buoyant and have the ascent accelerate out of control.
  * Prevention:
    * dive correctly weighted
  * Correction:
    * Vent gas through valves
      * need to make sure the valve can match the gas expansion rate
    * use ascent line to slow ascent 
    * flare body
    * dont hold breath (make a AHHHH sound as you exhale)

### Excess gas in the legs
* Excess gas in the suit legs can cause a runaway ascent by trapping an expanding gas volume where the diver can’t vent it.
* The diver rises to the surface, feet up, with the expanding volume making the legs swell. The fins may pop off and the diver may be stranded floating upside down, legs sticking out of the water.
* Cause:
  * have an excess buoyancy problem and allow your legs to get above shoulder level at the same time, or if you ascend with your legs about shoulder (exhaust valve) level.
* Prevention:
  * Avoid excess buoyancy
  * dont ascend upside down
  * some suits have valves at the ankles
* Correction:
  * grab something to hold you down and enough leverage to force legs down
  * if not:
    * roll into a head up position. Bend forward at the waist while kicking hard so you somersault into a head-up position.
    * tuck into a ball and roll sidewise onto your back while holding the exhaust valve open.

### Flooded Dry Suit
* If this happens need to end the dive
  * your insulation and buoyancy is lost
  * Minor leakage is fine, flooded suit is not
* Cause:
  * most common is the zipper being partial open
    * caught material
      * dirt, lint, etc
  * Exhaust valve leakage
  * tears or holes from seam failure
* Prevention:
  * proper maintenance
  * putting it on correctly
* Correction:
  * end the dive
  * use BCD for buoyancy
  * drop weight if needed
