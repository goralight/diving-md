# Dry Suit Diver
## Dry Suit Diving Guidelines

1. After this course, stay current with new dry suit diving procedures and techniques.
2. Always wear a BCD for surface flotation and back up buoyancy control. While underwater, use your dry suit for buoyancy control. (Note: This community guideline doesn’t apply to neoprene dry suits or tec diving in a dry suit.)
3. Know your equipment and emergency procedures.
4. Practice your dry suit diving skills under controlled conditions until they become second nature.
5. Dive with a buddy who understands your dry suit system.
6. Use the correct amount of insulation for the water temperature you are diving in and your exercise rate.
7. Weight yourself for neutral buoyancy at the surface — avoid overweighting. Proper weighting means you can make a 5 metre/15 foot safety stop at the end of the dive with approximately 30 bar/500 psi in your cylinder.
8. Check your valves, zipper and seals prior to each dive.
9. Clean your suit and valves after every dive and store your suit properly. Check for leaks. Have your suit serviced yearly by a qualified repair technician.
10. Know your limitations and do not exceed them.
