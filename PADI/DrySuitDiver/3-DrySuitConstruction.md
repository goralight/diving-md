# Dry Suit Diver

## Dry Suit Construction

### Dry Zippers

* Dry suits make use of water / air tight zippers
* It can take abuse but still need to be gentle with it
* Must replace it, if it is damaged
* Some suits can have a relief zippers which are used to go to the toilet
  * should not be used in the water
  * can also have a condom catheter set up

### Dry Suit Seals
* create a water tight connection at your wrists and neck
  * sometimes ankles but not common
* made out of latex rubber or neoprene
  * Latex Rubber Seals
    * most common
    * Soft, supple, seal well, easy to put on and off
    * easy to replace
    * Good quality latex have no memory
      * wont stretch after multiple use
    * Easily damage if careless when putting on or off the suit
    * outside of patching, almost impossible to repair
    * some suits have quick / easy swap
      * can take minutes to swap out
    * Does not insulate
  * Neoprene Seals
    * neoprene on skin side, nylon on the outside
    * Flat seal
      * wide and snug
      * less hassle to put on
    * Fold under seal
      * extra long and fold back on themselves
      * better seal than flat but longer to put on
    * normal use are the fold under
  * actually insulates

### Adjusting Dry suits
* Latex seal adjustment
  * You can cut .5cm from the end of a seal to create a larger hole - to help with fit
* Neoprene Seal Adjustment
  * if it is too tight, you can use a circular object to stretch it out
  * like an air tank
  * don't cut, only stretch
* DO NOT DIVE WITH A DRY SUIT NECK SEAL WHICH IS TOO TIGHT
  * causes the carotid sinus reflex
  * can cause circulation difficulties
  * will lower the heart rate

### Dry Suit Valves
* As you ascend and descend you need to be able to release or add gas
  * Similar how with a BCD (the air jacket)

* Inflator Valves
  * similar to the BCD inflator valve
  * normally found in the center of the suit
* Exhaust Valves
  * most of the time found on the left shoulder
  * allows you to release expanding air as you ascend
  * like the BCD exhaust valve, it needs to be at the height point to release
    * It will automatically release the gas, unlike the BCD
    * You do this by turning the outside of the valve to adjust how much air the suit will hold based on your buoyancy requirement.
    * you can still vent manually

#### Materials
* two types for dry suit, Neoprene and shell
  * Neoprene
    * Are basically wet suits that dont let water in
    * Provides insulation
    * very buoyant compared to shell, meaning need more weight
    * loses some insulation as you go depper
  * Shell 
    * Does not provide insulation, the undergarment does
    * Coated Fabric
      * light weight, compact
        * good for air travel
      * dry quick
        * good for field repair
      * normal buoyancy
      * no stretch
      * loose fitting means drag
    * Crushed Neoprene
      * no buoyancy
      * little insulation
      * very tough
        * resists abrasion, tears, punctures
        * good for wreck diving
      * Warmer than other suits
      * proper maintenance they can last for 2k dives
      * slow drying
        * annoying for storage or repair
      * heavy
    * Vulcanized rubber
      * no buoyancy
      * resist to abrasion and punctures
      * water runs off
        * quick for storage and travel
      * easy to field repair
      * heaviest
    * Trilaminate material
    * composite suits
      * a mixture of suits together
      * a common one is crushed neoprene from the waist down and trilaminate from the waist up
      *
