# Dry Suit Diver
## Dry Suit Repairs
* Its ok to patch up your suit
  * just follow the manual for the suit from the manufacturer
* Larger repairs though you should go an find a specialist (padi) or take it to the manufacturer
  * large tears
  * zipper
  * valves
  * boots
  * new seals
### Patching Punctures or Tears
* normally a suit comes with a small kit which normally contains
  * zipper lube
  * suit patches
  * cement
  * brush for the cement
  * aquaseal / cotol curing agents
* Also good to have these in your kit which you can add yourself
  * travel size hair dryer
  * old toothbrush (for zipper cleaning)
  * lead weights (to hold cement and patches down)
  * light, grease pencil, soapy water (to find and mark leaks)
  * rubber bands / jars / can / bottles (for closing seals when looking for small leaks)
  * Duct tape
#### Duct Tape
* Is a good method for temporarily patching a leak or puncture
  * key word being **Temporary**
* Find the hole on the inside of the suit
* make sure the area the glue of the tap will sit is dry
* place an amount to cover the hole, evenly
* then add a second layer which overlaps the suit and the first layer
* when you enter the water, check the tap holds before doing the dive
* **After the dive, remove the tape - dont leave it on**
* It is only for small leaks, if there is a chance that it will reopen during the dive, dont use that suit

### Finding the leak
* if in the water, raise a limb or the area which the cold sensation is coming from and look for bubbles
* use your slate to measure the distance from a point (eg, half slate length from elbow)
* note down the location on the slate
* if outside the water
  * you can put a flashlight into the suit and look for the light in a dark room
  * if you cant find it with a flash light, you need to inflate the suit
    * seal the neck and wrist seals with a can / rubber band and fill up with air using the inflator
    * place the suit under the water in a bathtub
    * look for bubbles and mark down the location
    * if you can use a bathtub, spray soapy water at an area and look for the rising bubbles

### Patch a leak
* dry the area
* if you are not using valcanized rubber suits, turn it inside out. otherwise you patch it on the outside
* Neoprene:
  * quite hard to fix
  * normally better to give it to the manufacturer
  * can inject cement with an 18 gauge needle
  * if it is a clean straight cut / puncture
    * grab a patch from repair kit
    * cover the hole with a good amount of overlap
      * from inside the suit
    * mark edges of patch
    * need to remove the nylon layer, with a soldering iron
    * once done add some solvent to remove th nylon and the neoprene
