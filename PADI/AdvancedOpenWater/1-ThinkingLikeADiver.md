### Planning Dives with Secondary Objectives

Every dive has one single primary objective that never changes. **All divers to return safely.**

A secondary objectives is anything you want to complete whilst returning safe. This can range from sight seeing, finding a specific fish, night diving, taking photos, etc.

Whatever it is, you must always remember that these objectives are always secondary.
Most incidents happen when the secondary objective becomes the primary; by exceeding planned limits, time, depth, gas supply, heat, etc. Due to the diver wanting to complete their secondary objective.
You can always come back to finish an objective if you always follow the first primary objective. **Don't push your safety margin.**
